## Import Data
```{r}
choco <- read.csv("https://ds202-at-isu.github.io/labs/data/choco.csv")
head(choco)
```

## Question Set 1
```{r}
print(nrow(choco))
```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(choco, aes(Review.Date)) + geom_bar()
```

## Question Set 2
```{r}
ggplot(choco, aes(Rating)) + geom_histogram(bins = 15)
```
The ratings are bimodal and slightly left skewed, few small end outliers

```{r}
ggplot(choco, aes(Rating, Cocoa.Pct)) + geom_point()
```
Cocoa percentage does not seem to have a large correlation with rating

```{r}
ggplot(dplyr::filter(choco, Company.Location %in% c("U.S.A.", "France", "Canada")), aes(Company, Rating)) + geom_boxplot()
```
